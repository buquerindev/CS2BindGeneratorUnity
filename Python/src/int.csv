snd_spatialize_lerp;L/R Isolation;*0% - Physically Accurate:* Physically modeled sound panning behavior most accurately reflecting the emitter position. \n *100% - Isolated L/R:* Sound emitters that are directly to the side of the player will be hard panned with minimal blending into the opposite L/R channel.
