# CS2 Config Generator
This application allows you to save your settings and binds into a 2 .cfg files, it also includes common settings/binds that are not included in the game but are used by professional players

The main advantage is that it uses [SDL Scancodes](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_Scancode) (which CS2 already does in the background) so there is compatibility with any keyboard layout
